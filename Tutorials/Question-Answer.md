  <dt>NodeJS</dt>
  <dd>Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript. </dd>

  <dt>Node.js Process Model</dt>
  <dd>Node.js runs in a single process and the application code runs in a single thread and thereby needs less resources than other platforms. All the user requests to your web application will be handled by a single thread and all the I/O work or long running job is performed asynchronously for a particular request. So, this single thread doesn't have to wait for the request to complete and is free to handle the next request. When asynchronous I/O work completes then it processes the request further and sends the response.</dd>

    5. Null<br/>  
    6. RegExp </dd>


<dt>Buffer</dt>
<dd>Node.js includes an additional data type called Buffer (not available in browser's JavaScript). Buffer is mainly used to store binary data, while reading from a file or receiving packets over the network.</dd>
